Hello hello there Sayucchi.
I hope this reaches your heart.

This is my gift to you, the girl who makes my world brighter every day and every night.
The girl who I have seen grow and reach for the sky.
The girl that I cannot express my love for as much as I want.

This is your diary, my love.
So that your memories are never lost, so that you never fade.
No matter what tries to take you away, here youâ€™ll always find your way back.

I love you for being you.
Never  let them tell you that you cannot fly.
Youâ€™re the one and only Sayu Aihara.

With love,
Link. ðŸ’žðŸ’–
